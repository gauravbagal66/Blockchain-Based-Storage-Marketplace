# Blockchain-Based-Storage-Marketplace
In this project, users are allowed to rent storage space from other users in a distributed network. The system uses blockchain technology and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks to manage transactions  and securely store data across multiple nodes. Advanced cryptographic techniques are employed to  ensure data security and integrity.
